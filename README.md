## 🧠 Core ideas (TL;DR)

* The terminal is more than a tool; it’s a **craft identity**.
* GUIs are great for discovery; CLIs are great for **power & composition**.
* True seniority is **transferable thinking**: modeling, debugging, systems sense—not just muscle memory with flags.
* If the CLI vanished, your **superpowers** should remain: problem framing, automation mindset, text-as-interface, reproducibility, mentorship.

## 🛠️ Build & formatting (optional)

No build is required to read the essay. If you want a site:

* **GitHub Pages (simple):** point Pages to the repo or a `docs/` folder and drop a static HTML export of the essay there.
* **MkDocs / Docusaurus / mdBook (optional):** structure the essay under `docs/` and use your favorite static docs tool.

## 🤝 Contributing

* Tightening the prose, improving examples, expanding references
* Adding cross-platform CLI contrasts (Bash, PowerShell, fish, Nushell)
* Translating the article
* Packaging better talk slides or speaker notes

**Pull Requests**

1. Fork & create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/topic`
2. Make changes with clear commit messages
3. Run spell/grammar checks if possible
4. Open a PR and describe the “why”, not just the “what”
