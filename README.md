## 🧭 Overview

This repository hosts the article **“Who Are You Without the CLI? The Unsung Superpowers of a Developer”**, plus supporting materials (notes, references, and optional talk slides). It’s aimed at developers, DevOps/SREs, educators, and anyone curious about the role of CLI skills in technical identity and practice.

## ✨ What’s inside

* `essay/` — the main article (Markdown-first).
* `assets/` — images/diagrams used by the article or slides.
* `slides/` — optional talk deck (PDF/Keynote/Reveal.js).
* `notes/` — research and extended references.
* `README.md` — you are here.

> Don’t see all these folders yet? No stress. They’re suggested structure; add what you use and delete the rest.

## 🔗 Quick links

* **Article (raw Markdown):** `essay/who-are-you-without-the-cli.md`
* **Slides (if present):** `slides/`
* **References:** `notes/references.md`

## 🧑‍🍳 How to use this repo

* **Read it:** open the Markdown in your editor or on GitHub.
* **Share it:** link directly to the Markdown or export to PDF.
* **Present it:** open `slides/` and use the deck as a talk outline.
* **Remix it:** fork and adapt for meetups, workshops, or team onboarding.

## 🧠 Core ideas (TL;DR)

* The terminal is more than a tool; it’s a **craft identity**.
* GUIs are great for discovery; CLIs are great for **power & composition**.
* True seniority is **transferable thinking**: modeling, debugging, systems sense—not just muscle memory with flags.
* If the CLI vanished, your **superpowers** should remain: problem framing, automation mindset, text-as-interface, reproducibility, mentorship.

## 🛠️ Build & formatting (optional)

No build is required to read the essay. If you want a site:

* **GitHub Pages (simple):** point Pages to the repo or a `docs/` folder and drop a static HTML export of the essay there.
* **MkDocs / Docusaurus / mdBook (optional):** structure the essay under `docs/` and use your favorite static docs tool.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Ideas include:

* Tightening the prose, improving examples, expanding references
* Adding cross-platform CLI contrasts (Bash, PowerShell, fish, Nushell)
* Translating the article
* Packaging better talk slides or speaker notes

**Pull Requests**

1. Fork & create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/topic`
2. Make changes with clear commit messages
